# XPLAB_2019 Project

This is a replication of the third experiment of the study "Using a foreign language reduces mental imagery" (2012) by Hayakawa and Keysars.

## Content of the experiment
The experiment examines whether the use of foreign language (i.e. English) decreases vividness of mental imagery and leads to more utalitarian moral decisions 
in comparison to native language (i.e. German).

Participants face a moral dilemma, the so called "footbridge problem". They have to make a decision whether or not to kill one man to save five others. 

In addition to the original experimental setup, we included another dilemma, the "self-driving car problem" to examine moral decision making in another context.
